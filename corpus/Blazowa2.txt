Pre-1939: Błażowa, town, Rzeszów powiat, Lwów województwo; 1939-1944: Blazowa, Kreis Reichshof, Distrikt Krakau, Generalgouvernement; post-1998: województwo podkarpackie, Poland
Błażowa is located 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of Rzeszów. The 1921 census reported 930 Jews living in Błażowa (18.2 percent of the total population of 5,123); another 51 Jews resided within the Błażowa gmina. The Błażowa Jewish community numbered 825 people in 1939.
After the Soviets invaded Poland from the east on September 17, 1939, German troops stationed in Błażowa tried to expel as many Jews as possible by ordering as many Jews to cross the San River – located less than 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Błażowa – which had already been reached by Soviet forces. A total of 57 Jews left Błażowa permanently, and 768 decided to stay. 
German authorities set up a Jewish council (Judenrat), with Abraham Unger as the chairman and Wolf Silberstain as the secretary. Mojsze Weiss was charged with assigning local Jews to labor conscription in accordance with German demands. Jakob Atlas was also a member of the Judenrat.
Members of Błażowa’s Jewish establishment were generally assigned to paid jobs that were fairly easy, such as working at a large estate occupied by German authorities. Both Poles and Jews worked the estate’s land; as laborers, Both Poles and Jews were not mistreated. Mojsze Weiss negotiated laborers’ paid minimum wages with the estate’s owner; most likely Both Poles and Jews received 1 or 1.20 złoty per day. Those Jews who were assigned to work for the municipality were unpaid. 
According to the survivor Jozef Atlas, the Germans did not interfere with local Jews and hardly ever came to Błażowa. It seems that there was only a Polish collaborationist (Blue) Police unit in the town, at least from the summer of 1941, when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. As Jakob Atlas reported, the Polish Police were ill-disposed towards the Jews and confiscated goods in the Polish Police's frequent house searches.
By July 1940, 89 deportees from Łódź and 50 from Kalisz had been transferred to Błażowa via Rzeszów. By mid-October 1940, 60 more had arrived from the same towns. In December 1940, the Judenrat reported the following statistics regarding Jewish residents in Błażowa: out of a total of 991 Jews, 778 (240 families) were locals. Out of the total of 213 newcomers, 154 were deportees (39 families) and 59 refugees (23 families). The latter came to Błażowa as they had relatives there and had to rely on they support.
Thirty of the deportee families (90 people) subsisted solely on the welfare provided by the Self-Help Committee set up by the Judenrat, as less then 10 of the newly arrived families were able to find employment. A parentless child that was found later in Błażowa was assigned to a private family for sustenance at the Judenrat’s expense.
